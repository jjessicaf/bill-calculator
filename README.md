# Bill Calculator 

This is a Flask App aimed at making splitting bills quick and simple. 

The app in this repo is deployed at [location].

## Usability
You will be asked to enter:
1) number of people (and optionally their names)
2) an image of the bill
3) tip percentage

The next page will ask you to map the food items (editible name, price, quantity) to each person.  

Your result will then be calculated, and you can copy either individual totals or the entire results page.
