## Usability
You will be asked to enter:
1) number of people (and optionally their names)
2) an image of the bill
3) tip percentage

The next page will ask you to assign the food items (editible name, price, quantity) to each person. Here you can: 
* select/deselect any person
* select/deselect any item
* update the item's name, price, quantity
* assign the same item to as many people as you would like
* items that are not selected are assigned to all individuals

Your result will then be calculated, and you can copy either individual totals (by clicking on them) or the entire results page using the share button.
